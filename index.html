            Refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #. Try selecting a

            The border property assigns a border with a width of 5px that is
            solid and gray.

            The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's
            frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas.

            The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are
            equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and
            false if the values are not equal.

          <li>
            We can store a group of related data (called an array) in a variable
            and use a (for) loop to perform a task on each piece of the data,
            using just a few lines of code.
          </li>
          <li>
            This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1
          </li>
          <li>
            As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of
            the array, the loop will keep running.
          </li>
          <li>
            The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the
            code loops, x will increase by 1.
          </li>
          <li>
            Eg for loop var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon",
            "circle"]; for(var x = 0; x< shapes.length; x++) {
            console.log(shapes[x]); }
